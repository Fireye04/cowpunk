:: Bounty 1 Mission
You approach [[the farmer|Farmer]] standing outside his barn. He's wearing stained overalls and a tacky orange bandana. 
His eyes widen and a bright smile appears on his face. He's missing a few teeth but a smile is a smile at the end of the day.

:: Farmer
\"Hey cowpunk! I reckon with that look in your eye you've seen my little advertisement? 
There's these huge rats chewing up all of my equipment! How's a farmer supposed to get any work done without my cyber tractor? 

Anywho, I'll pay ya nicely if you can [[take care of those pesky little critters.|Help Farmer]]"

"I lured 'em into the basement with some bait a couple of nights ago. 
A little too big for me to deal with myself, but I knew this job might fit someone like yourself. 
Here, I'll open the [[barn door.|Barn]]"

:: Barn
The farmer very quickly thanks you for your bravery and sheepishly shuts the door behind you. 
You can hear the latch shut on the outside, securing you and the rats in. 
Is he really that scared of a few rats? 
[[Look around|Look Around Barn]]

:: Look Around Barn
You see the [[basement door|Barn Basement Door]] in the far right corner of the room.

You see the [[basement door|Barn Basement Door]] in the far right corner of the room.

:: Barn Leftwall
Just some hay and feed. 
Living out in Cattle Run has familiarized you with with raising livestock and keeping western traditions alive. 
It's hard to find people who want this lifestyle anymore, especially being able to see the neon lights of the city anywhere you walk in Cattle Run.

[[Keep looking around|Look Around Barn 2]]

You see a table covered in sawdust, metal shavings, and various wires all connecting to who knows what. 
Must be the farmers workbench. Under the table you see a [[metal box|Farmer's Lockbox]] with a lock on it.
[[Keep looking around|Look Around Barn]]

The bullet hits the center of the lock and shatters it like it was made of glass.

/* TODO: Add Bounty1 Encounter*/
:: Barn Basement Door
You creep down the basements steps, readying your weapon.

You hear the scuffling of many feet, expecting a few rats. Large claw marks line the walls.

When you finally reach the bottom of the staircase, you see a shuffling mass the size of a bathtub.
Each of the rats is the size of a large tumbleweed and they seem to be stuck together at the tails.
No sense in reasoning with them.

/* ------------------------ Bounty 2 ------------------------  */
:: Bounty 2 Mission
You enter the bar and are welcomed with a polite smile by one of the bartenders. His robotic hand whizzes as is he peels an orange with perfect precision.
As he places the orange peel in the nearest patrons glass he asks, "How's it going partner? Don't think I've seen you 'round these parts."

He's right, you don't drink and certainly are only here [[for business.|Talk to Bartender]]

:: Talk to Bartender
You ask the bartender a question.

[[Have you seen anyone with a green hat?|Green Hat]]

:: Green Hat
Oh, yeah... Slippery Samuel. What a poor fellow.
[[Where is he?|Where is Slippery Samuel]]
or
[[What's wrong with him?|Slippery Samuel]]

:: Where is Slippery Samuel
"Umm... I wouldn't...know""

You notice their eyes keep darting towards a certain corner of the room. You turn to see what he's looking at and you see a table
in the corner of the room. There's a half empty glasss on it...and a green hat. [[You look back towards the bartender|Where is Slippery Samuel 2]]

:: Slippery Samuel
"You haven't heard? His wife and child died in a freak accident last month. He's been a mess ever since. Us barfolk have been keeping him company.
We all have our stories to share with eachother. Our manager doesn't seem to like our gratitude, but it's hard not to feel for the guy.
He only ever orders that one bottle that no one likes anyways. Anyways, [[why do you ask?|Where is Slippery Samuel]]"

:: Where is Slippery Samuel 2
"Hey...if you're going to do anything, just please don't hurt him?"

[[You wait|Where is Slippery Samuel 3]] at the bar for Slippery Samuel to come back.

:: Where is Slippery Samuel 3
After 15 minutes, you see someone walk in from the back entrance and head over to the table with the green hat. 
They gulp down the rest of the drink and pick up their hat. He neatly adjusts it over his head and gives a wave to the bartender without even looking at him.
He heads outside.
[[Follow him|Follow Slippery Samuel]]

:: Follow Slippery Samuel
You head outside and notice Samuel walking out towards one of the alleyways. 
No one else is around and whoever is near is still in the bar. 
[[You follow closely behind.|Follow Slippery Samuel 2]]

:: Follow Slippery Samuel 2
Now both of you are within the depths of the Ashes. The mehcanical wurring of the undercity is a lot more muffled now. 
As you follow behind him, you notice bottles and syringes lining the walls of the alleyways. Puddles of neon green liquid emit a sour smell as you walk by.
Who knows why anyone would subject themselves to this environment, even if you have your reasons.

As you leave your thoughts and lift your head up back to Samuel, you notice him staring at you.
[[He looks up at you.|Confront Slippery Samuel]]

:: Confront Slippery Samuel
Howdy partner... can I help you?

[[Tell him that you are here to collect the money for his tab.|Confront Slippery Samuel 2]]

Oh... well I suppose that I have been drinking a lot this month. I've been having to pay a lot of fees I'd never thought I'd have to pay.

[[Shoot him|Shoot Slippery Samuel]]

:: Shoot Slippery Samuel
You shoot Slippery Samuel and he falls backward against the wall of the alleyway. You look around and notice several windows of the upper level buildings closing swiftly.
That's how you deal with violence down here... you mind your business. You look back towards his body and notice his wallet peaking out of his pocket. 

[[Take his wallet|Take Slippery Samuel's Wallet]]

"Wait... are you serious? Partner, I cannot thank you enough! I swear, I swear, I'll head back home and pack my stuff right away. 
I'll be on the afternoon train tomorrow, don't you worry! You can tell whoever sent you that I'm dead, because I'll never be back here again.
Before I go, I have something that might be of use to you and your profession. I have no use for it where I'm going."

He reaches into his coat and pulls out a revolver. It's a very dark metal and looks expensive.

"I don't got nothing left to protect, cowpunk. [[She's yours|Samuel's Revolver]]"

/* TODO: Add revolver */
:: Samuel's Revolver
$Inventory.addItem(TheWidower)
He hands you the revolver and it's much heavier than yours. It takes a little extra strength to lift up, 
but it fits perfectly in your hand. You look up and he's already walking away.

Farewell partner. [[Head back to the bar.|Collect Bounty2 Reward]]

:: Collect Bounty2 Reward
You head back to the bar. As you walk in you notice that it's pretty much empty. The bartender is still there, drying off some glasses.
He notices you, but then quickly shifts his focus back to his job. 

You notice a door in the back that has the lights on still. [[Knock?|Manager's office]]

:: Manager's office
You knock on the door and hear large footsteps approach from the other side.
The door swings open and you see a massive man decked out in cybernetic enhancements from head to toe.

"Hey! We're clos-, hmmmm. You a cowpunk? 

Ahhh must be. 

I'm guessing the [[jobs done|Manager's office 2]] then eh?"

:: Manager's office 2
"Great! I appreciate your hard work buddy. Bounty was up for only 2 days and it got handled. 
Now that's what I call fast response time! I know you probably don't mind, but I apologize for the 
informal nature of this business. Couldn't risk getting involved with the law and I'll be damned if I sign a contract with those Corpos. 
I guess sometimes all you need is a hungry cowpunk. Here, [[your reward|Bounty2 reward]]"

:: Bounty2 reward
He throws $15 on the table and turns back around to continue counting a large pile of money.

"Hey, and anytime you're up at the bar, tell em I got you for a free drink. Cheers"

You're stunned with the irony of that statement for a few seconds. [[Take the money|Bountt2 reward 2]]

:: Bounty2 reward 2
<<set $money = $money + 15>>
You take the money and [[leave without saying a word.|Bounties]]


/* ------------------------ Bounty 3 ------------------------  */
:: Bounty 3 Mission
You head out to Ember City. The bounty said that he was selling horses to the rich.
These are work horses. In the city they're just going to be turned into show animals.
These city folk won't know how to take care of them and sure as hell won't be willing to do it themselves.

With anger in your heart you walk through the city square. Nothing looks out of the ordinary.
Skyscrapers line the corners of your vision. You do stand out among the Ember City folk, but no one fears you just because you're a cowpunk.

As you scan your surroundings, you notice a trail of dirt that leads around one of the buildings.
You follow it and with each step, the density of the town folk grows. You sidle by each person coming and going from this loud event and 
you eventually reach a point where you can see what they are all looking at.

In the center of the town, you see a haphazardly thrown together desert environment made out of cardboard.
There is a cardboard cactus with too many limbs painted with a neon green paint. There is an actual tumbleweed that somebody must've carried in from desert.
It's pretty much reduced to a pile of sticks due to everyone kicking it around. Then you notice the sharply dressed man in the middle with a cowboy hat on.

[[Tumbleweed Terry...|Tumbleweed Terry]]


:: Tumbleweed Terry
"Come one, come all! You city-folk finally have a chance to live out your western fantasies!
These horses were once legendary creatures that helped cowpunks chase down outlaws. What was once out of reach for 
you fancy city folk, is now for available thanks to yours truly...[[Tumbelweed Terry!|Tumbelweed Terry 2]]"


:: Tumbelweed Terry 2
As you get closer to the front of the audience, Terry notices you and your cowpunk get up.

"Woah there part-ner! Looks like we have a big fan! Now this is the type of commitment that you city-folk need,
lookie here!"

The crowd all turns to look at you. You can hear "oohs" and "ahhs" as they notice your outfit.

"Are you here to purchase a horse, or just show support young man?"

The smile leaves his face as he notices your blank expression.

[[Tell him that you know these horses aren't his to sell.|Tumbelweed Terry 3]]

:: Tumbelweed Terry 3
"Uhhhh... what are you talking about partner?! He he-"

He shuffles around uncomfortably and notices the judgemental murmers in the crowd.
He leans in closer to whisper to you.

"Come on pal, you're making me look bad. What, do you want a cut of the money or something?
I'm making a killing here. I know you're a cowpunk, but these folk don't know any better. 
What do ya say?"

[[Accept his offer (+$10)|Accept Tumbleweed Terry Bribe]]
or
[[Tell him that if he doesn't come with you then he'll never be able to set foot in Cattle Run again.|Confront Tumbleweed Terry]]

:: Accept Tumbleweed Terry Bribe
He hands you the money and gives you handshake. 

"See, was that so hard? Now [[beat it|Bounties]] I got a horse to sell."

:: Confront Tumbleweed Terry
Oh yeah? What are you going to do, shoot me? I bet you don't even know how to use that thing.

[[Intimidate him.|Pay for the horses]]

:: Intimidate encounter
There are balloons floating from the top of the fake cactus. You decide to show how deadly you are to intimidate Terry.
You quickly draw your gun and let off 3 shots in quick succession. [[Did you succeed?(Based off of your strength)}Intimidate encounter 2]]

:: Intimidate encounter 2
<<if $damage > 10>> [[*pop* *pop* *pop*|Intimidate Encounter Win]]

You quickly holster your gun while making eye contact with Tumbleweed Terry.

"Uhhhhh...woah. Shows over folks! We have a lucky winner here!"

He leans back in closer. 

"Well, what now cowpunk?"

[[You're going to jail.|Take Terry to jail]]

:: Take Terru to jail
He lets out a long sigh. "Welp, I guess a few weeks in the slammer is better than having my head shot like those balloons."

You help him up onto the horse and after you get on you tie his hands together.

"Is that really necessary?" He shouts?

You tap your gun on your hip as a reminder and he withdraws his attitude.

[["...Take us home cowpunk"|Bounty3 Reward]]


:: Bounty3 Reward
You head back to Cattle Run and approach the local jail. The sherrif notices you on one of the horses that was stolen and smiles.

"Hey cowpunk! I see that you've brought me a little prize! Mr. Terry...How long did you think you could get away for"
 [[Terry Answers| Bounty3 Reward 2]]"

:: Bounty3 Reward 2
"Well, I managed to get 5 before this cowpunk decided to mind my business."

The adjusts his belt before firing his response back. 
"5 huh? Well...5 months it is then. Help me [[get him inside cowpunk.|Bounty3 Reward 3]]"

:: Bounty3 Reward 3
<<set $money = $money + 15>>
Upon hearing his jail time, Terry starts kicking his feet and starts barking at the sheriff. 
The sheriff pays him no mind and even starts whistling as he helps you get Terry off the horse and into the cell inside.

After shutting the bars behind him, the sheriff walks around to his desk and pulls out the cleanest money you've ever seen.
He hands it to you and pats you on the shoulder.

Thanks a lot son. We're kind of low on horses out here as it is, so I'm glad we don't have someone thinning the heard anymore."

"And you know what...I think that horse suits you. You wouldn't mind taking good care of her now would ya?
It'll do you good as a cowpunk to have your own horse. Thanks again son, see you around."

/* ------------------------ Bounty 4 ------------------------  */
:: Bounty 4 Mission 
You head to the church out in the desert. You see folk just getting out of service and see their warm smiles and peaceful demeanors. 
You look around the building and towards some of the benches set around for people to congregate. 

No sign of Chrome Carl. You've heard the legends of him. He used to be a legendary figure in cowpunk culture but in recent years it seems that his gunfights have been
less honorable and more of a disorganized pattern of killing. I wonder if he's gone cyber-psycho?

You notice all of them in a placid mood. You dont know if you're going to find him here, but you also remember that many outlaws find religion eventually.
Something about their life path causes them to find seek a meaning and a purpose despite all of their wrong doing.

"Hello young man...what brings you here?" An old woman asks you.

You enter the church and look up at the beautifully shaped walls and ceilings. Ornate designs made out of marble with steel accents
highlight the original interior, plus modern rennovations thanks to donations from Ember City.

At the very front row of the church, you see a lone person dressed in all black. You walk closer and start to notice how bright the surrounding area is.
From what you can tell, most of his body is covered in cybernetic enhancements. His chrome skin is reflecting the light from the stained-glass windows.
Your eyes watched as the colors danced upon the church walls. 

His presence was haunting, yet beautiful.  The uncomfortable silence was broken by a single word.

"[[Leave.|Chrome Carl]]"

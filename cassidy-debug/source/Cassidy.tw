[[I'm here for the rent you've been missing | inquire on rent]]

"I see, so your one of them cowpunks then." Bill replied.
He lit a cigarette and took a long draw, then continued, "Listen, neither one of us wants this to get ugly, I've been having to pay fer my family's meds, and the booze barely pays for itself round this part of town, so what say you we just forget about the bounty and I give you $50 to tear it up?"

You don't have the funds to enter. You must [[Vault the turnstile. | vault into station]]

:: pass into station
You pay the fare and pass through as the turnstile clicks loudly. At the same time that you pass through, a man climbs over the turnstile next to you. 
You notice a security camera on the wall watching you closely, [[Say something to the man | shill]] or [[Ignore it and get the next person | not a shill]].

:: vault into station
You vault yourself over the turnstile and hit the ground loudly. At the same time that you pass over, a man climbs over the turnstile next to you. 
You notice a security camera on the wall watching you closely, [[Say something to the man | shill]] or [[Ignore it and get the next person | not a shill]].

:: shill
You call out to the man, accusing him of dodging the train fare. 
"Welcome to the real world goodie two shoes." He sneers back, as he keeps walking towards the train.
[["I said stop, you must pay your fare like everybody else" | argue]] you retort.

:: argue
"Nobody else cares, you corpo shill." The man responds, offended that you had the audacity to call him out.
With seemingly no other option, you must decide to [[escalate things | escalate]] or [[just leave it | leave it]]

:: escalate
Feeling like you don't have any other choice, you raise your gun towards the man. 
He throws his arms upward, "Woah! What the hell man! god damn I'll just pay my damn fare."
[[Collect the man's fare | next]]

:: leave it
You decide to let the man go and you watch as he boards the train. [[It's time to start keeping watch | next]]

You ignore the man and hope that whoever's behind the camera didn't notice. 
[[Stand at guard | next]] or [[Abandon the bounty | Bounty Board]]

Shortly after turning back to guard the turnstiles you see a man in a nice suit and a woman vault over the turnstiles in short succession. 
[[Call out to them, the fare must be payed. | two of them now]]

:: two of them now
The man seems to ignore you, but the woman turns to you and looks at you for a moment before responding, "Filthy cowpunks like you should mind their own business"
[[Mind your own business | do nothing]] or [[escalate things | do something crazy]]

:: do nothing
It's not worth even trying, the person behind the camera knows for sure that your heart isn't in it by now, you likely won't get paid at this point anyway. you should just [[leave | Bounty Board]].

:: do something crazy
You pull out your gun and point it at the man and woman across from you. The man in the suit perks up and looks at the gun.
"What the hell do you think yer doin there, I HAVE A MEETING TO GET TO!" 
The woman chimes in, "Just let us be, my boss won't be happy if I'm late."
You start to feel the [[pressure | pressure]] of the situation.
[[You could still leave, abandoning the assignment | Bounty Board]]

:: pressure
As you don't stand down, the man and woman start to berate you, but it all becomes a blur. 
You know they won't pay their fares if you just keep pointing the gun, you need to do something more to show them you're serious.
[[Shoot them | shoot]] 

:: shoot
You fire your gun until it runs out of bullets. 
The man lies on the ground in front of you, his suit now drenched in blood.
The woman lies sobbing behind him, her legs unrecognizable.
[[No one will be skipping their fares for quite some time. | congrats]]

:: congrats
After the day has passed and the train station shuts down, a tall man in a black suit approaches you, and hands you an envelope with <<link "$100." "Map">><<set $money = $money + 100>><</link>>
